Hello all,

I'm trying to build an app (a java vm) with the .20 toolchain and I'm getting stuck at:

signal.c:77: error: 'struct sigcontext' has no member named 'sc_esp'

Taking a look at the struct in question at: include/arm/signal.h:
http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/iphone-binutils/trunk/include/arm/signal.h?rev=134&view=markup

we see sigcontext defined as:

struct	sigcontext {
    int			sc_onstack;	/* sigstack state to restore */
    int			sc_mask;	/* signal mask to restore */
    unsigned int    sc_r0;
    unsigned int    sc_r1;
    unsigned int    sc_r2;
    unsigned int    sc_r3;
    unsigned int    sc_r4;
    unsigned int    sc_r5;
    unsigned int    sc_r6;
    unsigned int    sc_r7;
    unsigned int    sc_r8;
    unsigned int    sc_r9;
    unsigned int    sc_r10;
    unsigned int    sc_r11;
    unsigned int    sc_r12;
    unsigned int    sc_r13;
    unsigned int    sc_r14;
    unsigned int    sc_r15;
    unsigned int    sc_r16;
};


I need to replace sc_esp with one of the sc_r* register name but I don't know which
one.

Assistance from a signal/exception handling expert would be appreciated.

thanks,
Dario

sc_esp? That's the stack pointer on x86. Are you sure you're building for an ARM 
host?

In any case, the stack pointer is r14 on the ARM. See the ARM Procedure Call 
Standard for more details.

<PRE>Hey everyone,

Glad to see your interest in the iPhone binutils toolchain. With your help, we can 
make a set of open, free development tools that Apple will wish they had when 
developing the phone. :)

Let me give a general overview of where we are. The major parts of the 
toolchain are as follows:

LLVM: Apple is going to be using LLVM in the future for their GCC toolchain, so 
we should support it. We can use it now to get to the assembly stage, but it has 
serious compiler bugs, so we can't rely on it.

GCC: This should be the primary way to go from C source to assembler. We'll 
need to make our own modifications to make this work - naturally GCC works 
with the ARM, but making it work with Apple's dynamic linker is a different 
kettle of fish. I'll be focusing on this over the next few days: hopefully it 
shouldn't be too much work. We can use LLVM as a guide for this, because 
Apple's modifications to LLVM are publicly available.

as: We need this to assemble source object files. Apple's as is based on the 
ancient gas 1.38, which predates BFD, the system modern GNU uses to produce 
object files. BFD has no support for writing Mach-O format files, and the ARM 
assembler in the current gas is horribly welded to BFD. We need to write our 
own assembler, and this is where we could use the most help right now. I've 
already received a patch from tmiw, and hopefully you can help us out more.

ld: We need to extend Apple's linker with support for ARM. This shouldn't be too 
bad at all, once we have the assembler done: all we need is to implement ARM-
specific relocs, as well as a little glue code.

crt: This is the C runtime file that manages dynamic linking and sets up the C 
environment, necessary to run C programs. I've already written this for 
programs, and you can find it in the Csu directory. Possible improvements 
include support for creating dynamic libraries, which will be needed for some 
things like bash (needs readline).

That's where we are right now. If you'd like more information, please don't 
hesitate to contact me at this e-mail address or on IRC: irc.osx86.hu nick 
nightwatch. We probably aren't far off from having a working toolchain!

Patrick
